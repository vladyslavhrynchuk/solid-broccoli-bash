Parameter is any entity that stores values
Types of parameters: Variables, Positional parameter, Special parameters

Variables:
We can make Variable uppercase or lowercase.
Uppercase ${variable^} or ${variable^^}
Lowercase ${variable,} or ${variable,,}
We can get a length of a variable: ${#variable}
We can get a slice of parameter: ${variable:start:length}
	we cant start backwards ${variable: -start:length}

Command substitution:
We use Command substitution assing a variable result of a command
time=$(date)

Arithmetic expansion:
Arithmetic expansion allows us to perform arithmetic calculation:
$(( x+y ))
The result will be always given in int, to use fractions, we should use bc command

Tilda expansion:
Tilda(~)  expands for user`s home directory
~+ expands for user`s current working directiry
~- expands for user`s last seen directory
~NameOfTheUser expands for home directory of specific user

Brace expansion:
There are two types of brace expansion - String list and Range list.
String list:
echo {a,19,z,Name,43} - no spaces between arguments
Range list:
echo {1..10} - will print from 1 to 10
echo {10..1} - will print from 10 to 1
echo {a..z} - will print from a to z
echo {1..1000..3} - will print with step of 3
echo month{1..12} - will print from month1 to month12
echo month{01..12}/day{01..31}
