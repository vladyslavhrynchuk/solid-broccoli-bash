While loops
While loops are used to perform command while certain condition is true
Condition can be test ([) command or any outher command.
Syntax:
	while [ $x -lt 10 ]; do
		echo "hello"
		x=$(( $x+1 ))
	done

getopts
getopst command is used to read options from a script and perform certain actions.
Syntax: 
	getopts "ab" opt - here users can enter 2 valid options. Option will be stored on opt variable.
	getopts "a:b:" opt - here user can enter 2 valid options and provide some parameters to one of them. 
		options will be stored in opt variable. parameters of the option wil be stored in $OPTARG variable.
If getopts receives unknow option, it will write ? to getopts variable (opt in the preceeding example)

Read-while loops
Read-while loops is construction which allows to read files line by line
Syntax:
	while read line; do
		echo "$line"
	done < file.txt
Preceeding script will read file.txt line by line
We also can make script to read a custom file.
Syntax:
	while read line; do
		echo "$line"
	done < "$1"
The script will take file as positional parameter and read it line by line
We also can push to read-while loop a result of command by using process substitution
Syntax:
	while read line; do
		echo "$line"
	done < <(ls $HOME)
