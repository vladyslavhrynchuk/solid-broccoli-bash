List
List is when you put a number of commands into one line.
List can be created using List operators.
List operators are & ; && ||

Test command
Test command is used to compare different informtion
Test returns as a result of True value 0 and False value 1
[ 2 -eq 2 ]; echo $? will give output of 0
Test operator can be use to compare numbers, strings and files
Test operators for comparing numbers are:
	-eq to check if values are equal
	-ne to check if values are not equal
	-gt to check if first value greater than the secon value
	-lt to check if first value less then second value
	-geq to check if first value greater than or equal second value
	-leq to check if forst value less than or equal second value
Test operators fo comparing strings are: =, !=
	-z to check if the given string is empty
	-n to check of the given string is not empty
	[ -z $a ]; echo $?
	Example: a=hello; b-world; [ &a = $b ] ; echo $?
Test operators for files are:
	-e to check if file exists
	-f to check if file exists and it is a regular file
	-d to check if file exists and it is a directory
	-x to check if file exists and have executable permisions
	-r to check if file have read permisions
	-w to check if file have write permisions
	-nt to check if file is newer than another file
	Example [ -e file.txt ]; echo $?

if statement
if is a compound command. It starts with reserved word if and ends with reserved word fi.
syntax is:
if [ 2 -gt 1 ]; then
	echo "2 greater than 1"
elif [ 3 -gt 1 ]; then 
	echo "3 greater than 1"
else
	echo "else part"
fi

if statement conditions can be combined int more complex like [ $a=$b ] && [ $b=$c ];

case statement
case statement is useful whem performing operations based on value of one variable
it is also compound command and starts with reserved word case, ends with esac
syntax is:
case $number in
	23) echo "is 23";;
	[0-9][0-9][0-9] echo) "is 3 digit number";;
	*) echo "default output for case statement";;
esac
